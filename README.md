Analytics model to predict the probability a customer will default on loan repayment.

The aim is to have a model that can accurately predict probability of default on loan repayment in order to proactively take steps and measures to avert this.

Datasets(BLO3 & BLO5) are exclusive to loans data for the year 2022:

          1. Demographics
          2. Transactions
          3. Digital Channels
          4. Loans.
          
# Scope:
1. Ascertain potential Portfolio At Risk for loans disbursed to customers predicted to default.
2. Exploring the macro and micro level variables that predict the loan quality deterioration.
3. Using timely intervention to help minimise exposure to high-risk customers.

# Acceptance Criteria:
Acceptance will be determined by the business based on accuracy of the model upon experimentation. However, predictions churned out by the model MUST perform better than current system being used by business.
